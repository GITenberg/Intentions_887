description: Oscar Wilde was one of the most successful playwrights of the Victorian
  era. He was also a notorious supporter of the decadence and aesthetic movements,
  eventually jailed for having a young male lover. His name remains a by-word for
  social commentary by sharp wit. Intentions is a collection of critical essays by
  Wilde including The Critic as artist, The Decay of Lying, Pen, Pencil and Poison
  and The Truth of Masks.
